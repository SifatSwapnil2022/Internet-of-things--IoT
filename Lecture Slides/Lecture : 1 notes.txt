1. Definition of IoT
Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a fully networked and connected system where devices send analytics data back to the cloud or data center.

Key Points:

Every object or "thing" is provided a unique identifier.

Data is transferred through a network without verbal communication.

IoT is not just about connecting devices to the internet but also about enabling them to communicate, exchange data, process information, and control actions.

2. Formal Definition of IoT
IoT is a dynamic global network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities.

It is based on standard and interoperable communication protocols.

Physical and virtual "things" have:

Identities

Physical attributes

Intelligent interfaces

These things are seamlessly integrated into information networks that communicate data with users and environments.

3. Characteristics of IoT
Dynamic Global Network & Self-Adapting: Adapts to changes in context.

Self-Configuring: Automatically fetches software updates without manual intervention.

Interoperable Communication Protocols: Devices communicate using various protocols.

Unique Identity: Each device has a unique identifier (e.g., IP address or URI).

Integrated into Information Network: Allows devices to communicate and exchange data for analysis.

4. Physical Design of IoT
Things in IoT
Refers to IoT devices with unique identities that can perform:

Sensing

Actuating

Monitoring

IoT devices can:

Exchange data with other connected devices.

Collect data from other devices.

Process data locally or send it to centralized servers or cloud-based backends.

Generic Block Diagram of an IoT Device
IoT devices consist of several interfaces:

I/O interfaces for sensors and actuators.

Internet connectivity interfaces (e.g., USB, Ethernet, WiFi).

Memory and storage interfaces (e.g., NAND, DDR, SD).

Audio/Video interfaces (e.g., HDMI, 3.5mm audio).

5. IoT Protocols
IoT protocols are divided into different layers:

Link Layer
Ethernet (802.3): Coaxial cable, twisted pair, fiber optic.

WiFi (802.11): Operates in 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.

WiMax (802.16): Wireless broadband standards.

LR-WPAN (802.15.4): Low-rate wireless personal area networks (e.g., Zigbee).

2G/3G/4G/5G: Mobile communication standards.

Network/Internet Layer
IPv4: 32-bit address scheme.

IPv6: 128-bit address scheme.

6LoWPAN: IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks.

Transport Layer
TCP: Connection-oriented, reliable transmission.

UDP: Connectionless, faster but less reliable.

Application Layer
HTTP: Foundation of the World Wide Web.

CoAP: Constrained Application Protocol for IoT.

MQTT: Lightweight messaging protocol for constrained devices.

WebSocket: Full-duplex communication over a single socket.

XMPP: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol for real-time communication.

DDS: Data Distribution Service for device-to-device communication.

AMQP: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol for business messaging.

6. Logical Design of IoT
Device: Sensing, actuation, monitoring, and control functions.

Communication: IoT protocols.

Services: Device monitoring, control, data publishing, and discovery.

Management: Functions to govern the system.

Security: Authentication, authorization, message integrity, and data security.

Applications: User interface for controlling and monitoring IoT systems.

7. Communication Models in IoT
Request-Response: Client sends requests, and the server responds.

Publish-Subscribe: Publishers send data to topics, and subscribers receive data from topics.

Push-Pull: Producers push data to queues, and consumers pull data from queues.

Exclusive Pair: Bidirectional, full-duplex communication with a persistent connection.

8. REST-based Communication APIs
REST (Representational State Transfer): A set of architectural principles for designing web services.

Key Constraints:

Client-Server

Stateless

Cacheable

Layered System

Uniform Interface

Code on Demand

9. WebSocket-based Communication APIs
WebSocket: Allows bidirectional, full-duplex communication between clients and servers.

Key Features:

Follows the Exclusive Pair communication model.

Single TCP connection for all requests.

10. IoT Levels and Deployment Templates
IoT systems are categorized into 6 levels based on complexity and deployment:

IoT Level-1
Single node/device that performs sensing, actuation, data storage, analysis, and hosts the application.

Suitable for low-cost, low-complexity solutions.

IoT Level-2
Single node performs sensing/actuation and local analysis.

Data is stored in the cloud, and the application is cloud-based.

Suitable for solutions with large data but less intensive analysis.

IoT Level-3
Single node with data stored and analyzed in the cloud.

Suitable for solutions with large data and computationally intensive analysis.

IoT Level-4
Multiple nodes perform local analysis.

Data is stored in the cloud, and the application is cloud-based.
